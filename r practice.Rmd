## Intro to Markdown

Markdown allows you to do things like **bold**, *italic*, and more.

Make a list with asterisks like:

\* bold with double asterisks

\* italic with underscore

\* code-type fond with brackticks

You can also use hyphens instead of asterisks:

\- bold with double-asterisks

\- italics with underscores

\- code-type font with backticks

Be consistent!

For a numbered list:

1.  bold with double-asterisks
2.  italics with underscores
3.  code-type font with backticks


Hyperlinks are like [Hyperlinked text](https://mylink.org)

```{r load_data}
gap <- gapminder


```


```{r make-plot}
plot(lifeExp ~ year, data=gap)

```
```{r}
# this line will not run
temp <- c(1:3)  # this chunk of a line will not run



```
shortcut: option - for <-
